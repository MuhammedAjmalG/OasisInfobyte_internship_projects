# Email Spam Detector
This repository contains code and resources for building an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques. The project aims to enhance cybersecurity by automatically classifying emails as spam or non-spam, providing users with a reliable defense against unwanted and potentially harmful messages.

# Project Overview
Spam emails pose a significant threat in the digital world, and this project addresses the issue head-on. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the spam detector analyzes email content, extracts relevant features, and trains a model to accurately classify incoming emails. The result is an efficient and reliable email spam detection system.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a curated dataset comprising labeled email samples, including both spam and non-spam instances. The dataset covers a diverse range of email content, enabling the model to learn patterns and distinguish between genuine and malicious messages.
