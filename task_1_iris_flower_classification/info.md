# Iris Species Classification
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project that focuses on classifying different species of iris flowers based on their measurements.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By analyzing key features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, the model learns to differentiate between the species.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the popular Iris dataset, which is widely used in machine learning and data science. It consists of 150 samples, each with measurements for the four features mentioned above, along with their corresponding species labels.
