# Sales Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for a sales prediction project using machine learning techniques with Python. The project focuses on empowering businesses with the ability to forecast future sales by leveraging data-driven insights and advanced machine learning algorithms.

# Project Overview

Sales prediction is a critical aspect of business strategy, enabling organizations to optimize advertising expenditure, target specific customer segments, and select the most effective advertising platforms. Through this project, we explore the relationship between these factors and develop a robust machine learning model for accurate sales prediction.

# Dataset

The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset comprising historical sales data, advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform information. By analyzing this comprehensive dataset, we identify patterns and trends that contribute to sales performance.
